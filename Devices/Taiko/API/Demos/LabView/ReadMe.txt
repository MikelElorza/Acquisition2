The demo VIs have been originally created and tested with LabVIEW 2017.
To provide backward compatibility they have been also converted to LabVIEW 2010.
The original project file (Taiko.lvproj) can only be found in the LabVIEW2017 folder
and might be used with earlier versions of LabVIEW as well 
(possibly the LVVersion entry has to be changed manually).
