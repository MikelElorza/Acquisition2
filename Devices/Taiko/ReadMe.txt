This is the Taiko PDL M1 - software pack.

It may be distributed on CD or as a zip file via email or download.
In case of a zip file, please unpack it to a temporary hard disk location.

The folder "Installation" contains the Taiko SW setup file "PDLM_Drv_Setup.EXE".
You can run PDLM_Drv_Setup.exe directly from this folder on the CD or hard disk.
The setup program also installs drivers. Do not connect the device before
installing the software.

The PDLM_Drv software is suitable for Windows 8/8.1/10 (tm).
Consult your manual for detailed installation instructions.

In your start menu, Setup will create a lnk to the folder DEMOS which contains
demo source code as well as executables for accessing the Taiko PDL M1 system
from various programming languages.

To uninstall the PDLM_Drv software choose e.g. "programs and features" and
select 'PicoQuant - Taiko PDL M1 GUI 2.1' for de-installation. You could
also open your start menu and navigate to "PicoQuant - Taiko PDL M1 | Uninstall",
where you could click on 'Uninstall Taiko PDL M1 GUI', instead. In both cases,
it will remove all files that were installed by the PQLaserDrv setup program
but not any user files.
