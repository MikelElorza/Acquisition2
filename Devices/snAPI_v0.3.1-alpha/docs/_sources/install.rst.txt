Python
------

To install the package, follow these steps:

::

    setx PATH "%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python311;%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python311\Scripts;%PATH%" /M

This will add the Python 3.11 installation directory to the system path variable.

4. Close the Command Prompt and open a new one to ensure that the changes take effect.
