Introduction
============

snAPI, which stands for Snappy New API, is a powerful Python wrapper designed to enhance the functionality and performance of HARP devices, developed by PicoQuant. Built upon the Multiharp library, snAPI enables seamless communication and configuration with HARP devices, while providing efficient handling of large photon counts in real-time. It represents the swift and efficient nature of this cutting-edge software tool.

Harnessing the advantages of C++ for optimal speed and performance, snAPI bridges the gap between the high-speed capabilities of HARP devices and the ease of use and versatility of Python. By leveraging the low-level control offered by C++, snAPI ensures smooth and efficient data processing, enabling real-time analysis of megacounts of photons. Additionally, snAPI introduces a new dimension of flexibility by providing the option to access unfolded data.

With snAPI, users can now retrieve the unfolded data from HARP devices and leverage the power of Python to perform custom calculations and analysis. This capability opens up a whole new realm of possibilities, allowing researchers, developers, and scientists to delve deeper into their data and extract valuable insights. By directly accessing unfolded data in Python, users can build their own algorithms, implement complex calculations, and develop tailored data processing pipelines.

snAPI simplifies device communication and configuration, streamlining the process of integrating HARP devices into Python-based projects. With snAPI, users can focus on developing advanced measurement classes such as histogram, correlation, and timetrace, without worrying about the intricacies of device handling.

By providing a high-level interface to the underlying C++ library, snAPI enables Python developers to tap into the full potential of HARP devices while maintaining the flexibility and versatility of the Python programming language. Whether you are performing complex data analysis, conducting cutting-edge research, or building sophisticated applications, snAPI empowers you to harness the power of HARP devices and customize your data calculations directly in Python.

In summary, snAPI serves as a bridge between the capabilities of HARP devices and the Python ecosystem, offering efficient device communication, configuration, and data handling. With its added support for accessing unfolded data, snAPI enables users to perform custom calculations and analysis directly in Python, empowering them to extract valuable insights and build tailored data processing pipelines.
